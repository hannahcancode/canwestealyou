It looks like we made it. Look how far we've come, my baby. (Ten points if you're singing that in your head already.) Now we've come to the end of the road, and I can't let go. (Another ten points.) What a final week it was! #TeamLee vs. #TeamMattyJ came down to the wire and gosh we were in it right until the end. Meanwhile, awful news broke late last night after recordingâ€”Georgia's mum lost her fight with cancer on Saturday. RIP and our condolences to the Love family. Time for a break.
